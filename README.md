Alblang
=======

**Current status:** *Designing!*

Alblang is a dynamic language, that it would like to be a parallel computing programming Language, easy to do parallel executions. It works in a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler way.


Specs
-----

- interpreter or compiler?
- parallel computing (distributed parallel execution? high-performance?)
- Dynamic language
- JIT compiler
- Garbage Collector
- object oriented vs functional language?


Special Characteristics
-----------------------

- extensive mathematical function library?
- easy distributed for paralled execution
- like hadoop software?
- easy find bugs between thousand of machines
- use extensively multicore processors
- network facilities?
- continuous deploy of some part of the code?!
- easy to build large systems??!!
